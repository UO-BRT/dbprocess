Description: This package is designed to be used in conjunction with the 
  orextdb package. The orextdb package retrieves data from the live ORExt 
  database, through a secure web API, and this package processes the data. In
  particular, you should not need to ever retrieve specific tables from the
  live DB, becuase this package will pull the table needed and combine them
  in a way that they are ready for analysis.
