The purpose of **dbprocess** is to process the raw tables exported from [orextdb](https://github.com/UO-BRT/orextdb) in preparation for analysis.

This package is meant to be used in conjunction with two other packages, please see [`{exirt}`](https://github.com/UO-BRT/exirt) for an explanation of the three-package pipeline.
